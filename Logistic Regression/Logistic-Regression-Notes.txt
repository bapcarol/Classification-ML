----- Logistic Regression -----

1. What is Logistic Regression?

-> Is a classification algorithm for categorical variables
-> Use one or more independent variable to predict the dependent variable
-> Predict a binary categorical field that can be coded between zero or one
-> All the independent variables are coded to become numeric using dummies or something else


2. What kind of problems can be solved with LR?

-> Probability of a person having a heart attack
-> mortality of injured patients
-> failed of a given process or product
-> propensity to purchase a product


3. Situations which you can use LR?

-> When your target field in your data is categorical and binary (yes/no; 0/1; true/false)
-> If you need probabilistic results
-> When you need a linear decision boundary -> divide dataset between the two classes
