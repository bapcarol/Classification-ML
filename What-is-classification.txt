----- Classification -----


1. Definition: 

-> A supervised learning approach.
-> Categorize some unknown items into a discrete set of categories or "classes".
-> The target attribute is a categorical variable.

-> Can be both binary or multi-class


3. Use cases

-> Churn, response to something, category customer belongs etc.

4. Classification Algorithms

-> Decision Trees
-> Naive Bayes
-> Linear Discriminant Analysis
-> k-Nearest Neighbor
-> Logistic Regression
-> Neural Networks
-> Support Vector Machines (SVM)
